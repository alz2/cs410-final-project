Traditionally, software engineers have tried, either to formally verify their design or test their system on a variety of inputs. In formal verification, one describes the program in some mathematical formalism and then tries to prove its correctness. Verifying systems does not guarantee correctness because it is the design, and not the implementation, that is verified, and because resource limitations prevent the", "The Impact of Arousal on Judgment Correction by Hila Riemer and Madhu Viswanathan Member Login Sitewide search All proceedings About ACR What is ACR What We Stand forACR HistoryWhat We Offer Governance and Officers ACR ConstitutionThe Organization of ACRBoard of DirectorsPast Board MembersACR OfficersElection ProceduresMinutes and Financial Information Core Activities ConferencesPublicationsACR Awards Join ACR Who Should Join?Member BenefitsJoin ACR Now Conferences ProceedingsACR FilmsThe ACR ConferenceACR International ConferencesTransformative Consumer Research (TCR) ACR Grants Call for ProposalsPast WinnersACR/Sheth Foundation Grants JACR About JACRLog in to read JACR ACR Films Search ACR FilmsBrowse ACR Films TCRResources ResourcesACR Listserv Search Conference Proceedings Tweet The Impact of Arousal on Judgment Correction Hila Riemer, Ben Gurion of the Negev, IsraelMadhu Viswanathan, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA This study focuses on the interplay between arousal,\u00c2\u00a0motivation", "Classification learning using all rules | SpringerLink Skip to main content Skip to sections This service is more advanced with JavaScript available, learn more at http://activatejavascript.org SpringerLink Search Home Contact us Log in European Conference on Machine Learning ECML 1998: Machine Learning: ECML-98 pp 149-159 | Cite asClassification learning using all rulesAuthorsAuthors and affiliationsMurlikrishna\u00a0ViswanathanGeoffrey\u00a0I.\u00a0WebbMultiple Models for ClassificationFirst Online: 16 June 2005 1 Citations 90 Downloads Part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science book series (LNCS, volume 1398)AbstractThe covering algorithm has been ubiquitous in the induction of classification rules.

Crucial aspects of the computational model include the space complexity of the testers and spot-checkers (ideally much lower than the size of the input stream) and the number of passes that the tester or spot-checker must make over the input stream (ideally one, because the original stream may be too large to store for a second pass).A sampling-tester", "", "D ryVR: Data-Driven Verification and Compositional Reasoning for Automotive Systems | SpringerLink Skip to main content Skip to sections This service is more advanced with JavaScript available, learn more at http://activatejavascript.org SpringerLink Search Home Contact us Log in Download book PDF EPUB International Conference on Computer Aided Verification CAV 2017: Computer Aided Verification pp 441-461 | Cite asDryVR: Data-Driven Verification and Compositional Reasoning for Automotive SystemsAuthorsAuthors and affiliationsChuchu\u00a0FanEmail authorBolun\u00a0QiSayan\u00a0MitraMahesh\u00a0ViswanathanConference paperFirst Online: 13 July 2017 1 Mentions 2 Readers 994 Downloads Part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science book series (LNCS, volume 10426)AbstractWe present the DryVR framework for verifying hybrid control systems that are described by a combination of a black-box simulator for trajectories and a white-box transition graph specifying mode switches.
